# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.4] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **feat(docker): stream large blob uploads to disk to bound memory** — Docker blob uploads at or above `NORA_DOCKER_STREAM_THRESHOLD_MB` (default 1024 MiB) are now streamed chunk-by-chunk to a temp file rather than buffered in memory. SHA-256 is computed incrementally so no second read of the file is needed. Smaller uploads retain the fast in-memory path. Eliminates OOM kills when pushing multi-GB AI model layers.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Security audit report** — static-analysis audit of source and supply chain published as `SECURITY-AUDIT.md` in the repository root.

### Fixed
- **OpenAPI 429 documentation** — all rate-limited endpoints (44 total) now document `429` response with `Retry-After` header in OpenAPI spec. Eliminates false positives from API fuzz tools like Schemathesis (#267)
- **405 Method Not Allowed with Allow header** — unsupported HTTP methods on multi-method routes now return `405` with RFC 9110 `Allow` header instead of axum's default headerless 405. Affected registries: Docker, Raw, Maven, npm, PyPI, Cargo (#268)

### Changed
- Docker and Maven/npm route definitions merged from separate `.route()` calls into explicit method chains for correctness and clarity
- Raw registry docs corrected: files are immutable by default (409 on re-upload), not overwrite-only. Conditional overwrite via `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` documented
- Raw `PUT` OpenAPI spec updated with `200` (conditional overwrite) and `412` (precondition failed) responses

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **TTL race condition** — unified TTL semantics across registries; repo_index invalidation no longer races with concurrent publishes (#266)
- **NuGet autocomplete leak** — `SearchAutocompleteService` URLs in service index now rewrite to NORA instead of leaking to `azuresearch-*.nuget.org`. New `/nuget/v3/autocomplete` proxy endpoint with graceful fallback (#262)
- **NuGet gallery leak** — `SearchGalleryQueryService` root URLs (`azuresearch-{usnc,ussc}.nuget.org/`) now rewrite to NORA. Zero azuresearch URLs remain in service index
- **NuGet 429 during cache warming** — registry proxy routes no longer double-limited by `general_limiter` + `upload_limiter`. Removes 429 errors during `dotnet restore` with many packages while keeping auth rate limiting active
- **E2E test paths** — NuGet smoke tests used wrong paths (`/v3/flat/` → `/v3/flatcontainer/`, `/v3/search` → `/v3/query`)

### Added
- **NuGet search fallback** — local search from repo index when upstream is unavailable, download tracking for proxied packages (#261)
- **Env var naming guideline** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents `NORA_{SECTION}_{FIELD}` pattern with abbreviation convention (`NORA_CB_*`)
- 910 total tests (up from 909)

### Changed
- Docker base images switched to real RED OS and Astra Linux images (#260)
- NuGet autocomplete config: env var `NORA_NUGET_AUTOCOMPLETE`, config field `autocomplete`

- **Error logging** — better error messages for proxy failures (#259)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Hash Pin Store** — content-addressable integrity verification for all stored artifacts, `put_if_absent()` semantics with NDJSON persistence (#229)
- **Trusted proxy support** — `NORA_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXIES` accepts CIDR ranges for X-Forwarded-For extraction (#230)
- **Cache-Control headers** — proper caching directives for proxy registries: Docker, Maven, npm, Cargo, PyPI, Go, Pub, Raw (#230)
- **Auth rate limiting** — per-IP exponential backoff on failed authentication (429+Retry-After) (#229)
- **Docker publish_locks eviction** — automatic cleanup of stale upload locks (#230)
- **GOVERNANCE.md and ROADMAP.md** — project governance model and public roadmap (#228)
- **Version consistency gate** — `scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` validates Cargo.toml vs OpenAPI vs Cargo.lock versions, enforced in release pipeline (#224, #225)
- 908 total tests (up from 851)

### Fixed
- **Docker proxy timeout** — default timeout raised from 60s/120s to 300s, large image pulls no longer time out (#233)
- **Unicode path validation** — non-ASCII characters in Maven/Raw upload paths now return 400 instead of 500 (#234)
- **Docker /v2/ auth** — require authentication per Docker V2 spec (#220)
- **Curation bypass token timing** — constant-time comparison using `subtle` crate (#230)
- **S3 paginated listing** — storage size calculation now handles >1000 objects correctly (#230)
- **Docker temp file cleanup** — upload temp files are removed on failure (#230)
- **OpenAPI schema deduplication** — removed 8 duplicate type definitions (#227)
- **OpenAPI status codes** — documented 400/409/413/422/503 responses that API already returns (#235)

### Changed
- Mobile-responsive UI — dashboard grid, hidden table columns on small screens, Raw registry "Files" tab (#218)
- Startup metric renamed to `startup_duration_ms` with Cold Start display on dashboard (#218)
- Guardrails: semver-checks, Renovate config, pre-commit hooks, clippy deny rules (#225)

### Security
- Rate limiting hardening for token endpoints (#229)
- Curation completeness checks for all registry formats (#230)
- Raw registry glob pattern validation (#230)

## [0.7.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Docker /v2/ auth flow** — endpoint now correctly returns 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header when auth is enabled. Previously, Docker clients received 200 OK without authentication, causing `docker login` to appear successful while `docker pull`/`docker push` failed with "unauthorized" (#219)
- **Raw registry curation bypass** — raw was the only registry without `check_download()`, completely bypassing curation enforce mode. All 13 registries are now curated consistently
- **Timing side-channel on bypass token** — replaced string comparison with constant-time comparison (`subtle` crate) to prevent timing attacks
- **Maven glob matching** — `com.evil.**` pattern now correctly matches `com.evil:lib` (colon separator for Maven groupId:artifactId)
- **Mobile dashboard** — responsive layout with 3-column stats grid, compact padding, and word-wrap on small screens

### Added
- **Raw directory browser** — nested navigation with breadcrumbs, folder/file icons, directories-first sorting. Browse raw artifacts at any depth
- **Docker Hub images** — NORA is now published to Docker Hub as `getnora/nora` alongside GHCR
- **Docker-Distribution-API-Version header** — `/v2/` response now includes `registry/2.0` header per Docker Registry V2 spec
- **Startup time metric** — `startup_duration_ms` exposed on dashboard (cold start tracking)
- 857 tests (up from 851)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Publish date extraction** — curation min-release-age filter now extracts real publish dates from cached metadata for npm, PyPI, Cargo, and Go registries (#207)
- **Per-registry curation overrides** — configure min_release_age per registry via TOML (`[curation.npm] min_release_age = "3d"`) or env (`NORA_CURATION_NPM_MIN_RELEASE_AGE`) (#205)
- `parse_iso8601_to_unix()` helper for ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 date parsing across registry formats

### Fixed
- Raw registry: UI now updates immediately after upload/delete — added missing `repo_index.invalidate("raw")` calls (#212)

### Verified
- Token RBAC: `last_used` tracking (deferred flush), auto-expire rejection, description field — all functional (#206)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Min-release-age filter** — block packages younger than N days/hours/weeks (#132). Config: `min_release_age = "7d"`, env `NORA_CURATION_MIN_RELEASE_AGE`
- **Token RBAC** — read/write/admin roles per token, expiry badges in UI, expired tokens sorted to bottom (#124)
- **Dynamic stats footer** — demo builds show live binary size, VmRSS, registry count from /proc (replaces hardcoded values)
- 850 total tests (up from 821)

### Changed
- Token list UI: expired tokens show red badge, sorted to bottom with reduced opacity
- `format_expiry()` replaces `format_timestamp()` for token expiry display — correctly shows "in 28d" for future, "expired 3d ago" for past
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on `Role` enum for forward compatibility

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-27

- **Go retention collector** — `keep_last` for Go modules, parsing `module/@v/version.{info,mod,zip}`
- **Audit log** — one entry per retention run with keys/bytes/duration
- 588 total tests (up from 577)

### Changed
- GC now requires `--apply` flag to delete (dry-run by default)

- Cargo crate names normalized to lowercase across all endpoints (publish, download, metadata, sparse index) for consistent storage keys
- Cargo publish write ordering: index written before .crate tarball to prevent orphaned files on partial failure
- Cargo conflict errors now return Cargo-compatible JSON format (`{"errors": [{"detail": "..."}]}`)
- PyPI hash fragments preserved when rewriting upstream links (PEP 503 compliance)
- Redundant path traversal checks removed from crate name validation (charset already excludes unsafe characters)

### Changed

- **npm publish**: `PUT /npm/{package}` принимает стандартный npm publish payload с base64-тарболами
- **npm metadata TTL**: Настраиваемый TTL кеша (`NORA_NPM_METADATA_TTL`, default 300s) с stale-while-revalidate
- **Immutable cache**: SHA256 проверка целостности npm-тарболов — обнаружение подмены при отдаче из кеша

### Security / Безопасность
- **Path traversal protection**: Attachment filename validation in npm publish (rejects `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Package name mismatch**: npm publish rejects payloads where URL path doesn't match `name` field (anti-spoofing)
- **Version immutability**: npm publish returns 409 Conflict on duplicate version
- **Защита от path traversal**: Валидация имён файлов в npm publish (отклоняет `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Проверка имени пакета**: npm publish отклоняет payload если имя в URL не совпадает с полем `name` (anti-spoofing)
- **Иммутабельность версий**: npm publish возвращает 409 Conflict при попытке перезаписать версию

### Fixed / Исправлено
- **npm proxy_auth**: `proxy_auth` field was configured but not wired into `fetch_from_proxy` — now sends Basic Auth header to upstream
- **npm proxy_auth**: Поле `proxy_auth` было в конфиге, но не передавалось в `fetch_from_proxy` — теперь отправляет Basic Auth в upstream
